# Parllelisation of Matrix Multiplication
## Parllelism Implementation
Matrix multiplication can be parallelized using threads by dividing the workload among multiple threads, with each thread computing a portion of the resulting matrix. This involves partitioning the input matrices into smaller blocks or rows/columns, and assigning each thread to work on a separate block or set of rows/columns. Synchronization mechanisms ensure data consistency, enhancing performance and efficiency through thread-level parallelism on multi-coreÂ processors.
